----------About This Project----------

This is the 2nd project under Javascript section in course Full Stack With Javascript in TOP(The Odin Project). In this project I'm making a tic tac toe game which a user can play with a bot or either with a friend (As I'm writing this I'm not sure if I'll create the 'with a bot' partüòÅ).
